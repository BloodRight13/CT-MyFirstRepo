Curently I have been learning a lot form coding temple. At first I was very slow pacing to the coding aspect of it all. The past week with learning github and the git commands in the VS terminal has been a challenge. The videos given to the students have been very helpful in my journy in learning github. 
I am also a big history fan so learning the history of coding and the backgorund of it all was very interesting to me. 
I am excited to take the next step into learning python and begin my coding portfolio with my first project in the next chapter after this one.
